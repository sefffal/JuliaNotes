It is now the de facto language in astronomy. However, we were aware of the two language problem at the time, but did not have the time nor the resources to implement a new language. Knowing this limitation, I was prepared to adopt Scipy's successor, if and when it arrived. Julia is that successor. Like 25 years ago, I am now advocating for Julia to become the de facto language in astonomy.\n",
