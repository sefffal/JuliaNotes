# JuliaNotes
This repository houses notes for a Julia intro workshop.

You can clone them using `git` or download as a zip file using the `Code` button above.

You can view the content as a notebook in Jupyter or VSCode in `notes-1.ipynb`, or as plain Julia code in `notes-1.ipynb`.
The file `notes-1.html` has the notebook and all the output as an HTML file you can download and view without using Jupyter.
